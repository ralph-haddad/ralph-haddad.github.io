    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Ralph Georges Haddad. I am not a coder or anything, but I was always in love with the concept of the internet with pure html, no css, no
    javascript. Just a repository of information.</p>
    <p>It may look cluncky. It is however the best way to allow everyone to participate in the internet. No hosts, no eye candy: just the information, pure
    and simpe!</p>
    <p>I just added my github repo to my git baash on my computer. It is showing to be extremely easy. I think I am lucky to live in this age</p>
